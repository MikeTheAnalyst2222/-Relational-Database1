DBMS -> C-R-U-D: Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete

2 Types of DB: Relational Database(use SQL and store data in tables, rows & columns) & Non-Relational Database(store data using other data structures).

RDBMS(Relational Database Management System) tools are: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL MariaDB, etc.

As database get more complex, it makes a difficult to locate a particular information from the database, so, the good way to retrieve information is by the use of SQL.


DBMS Terminologies: Primary key is unique to each relational database.

Foreign keys: in DBMS stores the primary key of a row in another database table. 

Composite Key: is made of 2 columns of primary keys.

SQL = Structure Query Language: is used to interact with Relational DBMS.
SQL can perform administration tasks(e.g, security, user management, import/export, etc.)
SQL is consists 4 types of languages into one.
i. DQL = Data Query Language
ii. DDL = Data Definition Language
iii. DCL = Data Control Language
iv. DML = Data Manipulation Language

PopSQL: is a text editor using to queries MySQL database and get the information back.

SQL Data-type: INT, DECIMAL(M,N), VARCHAR(1), BLOB(Binary Large Object, stores large data), DATE, TIMESTAMP;

1st thing in SQL is to define your SQL SCHEMA;

DROP TABLE: means to delete table in SQL;

* is use to grab all the information in a particular table.

SQL Commands: <> Not equal to, -- anything after this will be a command.

Whenever we set FOREIGN KEY, we must include [ON DELETE SET NULL] in the command statement.

Whenever we set COMPOSITE KEY(more than one primary key), we must include [ON DELETE CASCADE] in the command statement.

% =means any number(#) of characters, _ =means one character.

TRIGGER test: is a form of alert whenever the row/column got added. 

ER(Entity Relationship) Diagram: consist of Conceptual and Physical.
